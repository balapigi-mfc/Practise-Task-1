        <p>I'm Miraj, the guy behind this website. I'm an Bangladeshi who's been traveling the world full time for 0 years now. <br>

            I started this travel blog in 2025 to document my own international trips, share my photos, and help others learn how to travel the world and find some really good spots off the beaten path. <br>
            
            All of the writing and pictures on this site come from my own personal experience. <br>
            
            I'm currently based in Dazhou, China, where I met my friend Maruf, who’s a Dhaka local. Now he joins me on these learnig website adventures too. <br>
             
            Together, we've done some bucket list hikes, climbed active volcanoes, seen exotic wildlife, and visited some spectacular castles, temples, and monuments around the world. <br>
            
            I've worked with and been featured by Wandakai Media, 2pro4u Shop, Chalu Chalu deals, and other companies. <br>
            
            I haven’t been everywhere, but it’s on my list. I hope this world travel blog can help and inspire you in your own journeys as well!</p>
